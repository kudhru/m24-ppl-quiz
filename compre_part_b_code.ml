(** Important Assumption: For Simplicity, our train reservation system does not have any notion of date. So, whenever we talk about any operation such as booking a ticket or checking seat availability in a specific train, we do not care about date. In other words, there is only a single instance of any train for which we are going to perform operations. Think of reservation system for just a single day *)
